This GitHub repository contains a Microservices Solution built on .NET Core 6, consisting of 7 APIs that collectively form a robust and scalable architecture for various business operations. The solution leverages Microservices architecture, Repository Pattern, JWT Authentication, and AMQP-based integration services for seamless communication between the APIs. Additionally, it includes an Identity and JWT generation Authentication API and a Back-For-Front API, along with a client application following the MVC pattern.

## [Project Structure](#project-structure)
The ASP.NETCoreEnterpriseApplications Solution has a modular structure, with each API residing in its own project. The core components are:

<ul>
  <li><b>NSE.Carrinho.API:</b> Handles shopping cart-related operations.</li>
  <li><b>NSE.Catalogo.API:</b> Manages product catalog and related functionalities.</li>
  <li><b>NSE.Cliente.API:</b> Handles customer information and accounts.</li>
  <li><b>NSE.Pagamento.API:</b> Provides payment processing services.</li>
  <li><b>NSE.Pedido.API:</b> Manages order processing and fulfillment.</li>
  <li><b>Authentication API:</b> Provides user identity management and JWT token generation.</li>
  <li><b>Back-For-Front API:</b> Serves as a middleware layer to simplify communication between the client and the backend microservices.</li>
  <li><b>Client Application:</b> An MVC-based client application to interact with the microservices.</li>
</ul>
